# Challenge-5: Calendar App

## Description
A calendar app that display the current day, and allows you to add tasks in any one of the time slots and save the information entered.

## Usage
When the user loads the page, a Calendar app with the current day of the week and year appears along with a calendar displaying timeslots for that business day. 

When the User clicks in the text blocks, they are able to type tasks for that day, and save them by clicking on the save button in its row. When the User then loads the page, the saved task remains saved. 

The User knows which time slots are in the past, present, and future because they are color coded and working in real time.
